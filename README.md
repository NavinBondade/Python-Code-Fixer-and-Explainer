<p>Programming is not an easy task as it involves many types of complexities, because of which we often encounter various errors. Comprehending these errors and fixing the code requires a strong understanding of the code and brilliant debugging skills. The errors are often so subtle and tough to catch that the developer spends hours fixing them. Also, a huge chuck of time goes into searching the solution online at websites like StackOverflow. In short, this is a very hectic and time-consuming task. So, in order to make it easy, I have developed an AI system that not only fixes your Python code with one click but also explains the error and its solutions.
