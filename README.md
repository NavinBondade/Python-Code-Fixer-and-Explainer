<p>Programming is not an easy task as it involves many types of complexities, because of which we often encounter various errors. Comprehending these errors and fixing the code requires a strong understanding of the code and brilliant debugging skills. The errors are often so subtle and tough to catch that the developer spends hours fixing them. Also, a huge chuck of time goes into searching the solution online at websites like StackOverflow. In short, this is a very hectic and time-consuming task. So, in order to make it easy, I have developed an AI system that not only fixes your Python code with one click but also explains the error and its solutions.

<h2>Libraries Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>LangChain</li>
  <li>Hugging Face</li>
  <li>Streamlit</li>
</ul>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>The AI system has two engines, meaning it utilizes two large language modes at its core. The first one is the CodeLlama model that is used to fix the errored code of the user. With the prompt engineering technique, I crafted a custom prompt that incorporate instructions about what the CodeLlama model should do. The prompt also includes the errored code and the error message generated by the Python interpreter. This prompt acts as input to the CodeLlama model. Considering the error message with respect to the user's code, the CodeLlama model produces the error-free fixed code. The second model here is the Zephyr model. A custom prompt mentioning "explain the error" and the user-provided error message is passed to the Zephyr model. After understanding the error, the model outputs a short but accurate explanation of the error message. Streamlit is used to develop the web app.</p>
