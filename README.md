<p>Writing functional code is not an easy task as it involves many types of complexities. It requires a strong understanding of the programming language and brilliant debugging skills. Developers have often found either writing very unoptimal code or totally lost in resolving bugs and errors. In order to make it easy, I have developed an AI system that writes Python code as per the provided question. The system is also capable of fixing your Python code with one click and explaining the error and its solutions.

<h2>Libraries Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>LangChain</li>
  <li>Hugging Face</li>
  <li>Streamlit</li>
</ul>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<h3>Python Code Fixer and Error Explaine</h3>
<p>This AI system has two engines, meaning it utilizes two large language modes at its core. The first one is the CodeLlama model that is used to fix the errored code of the user. With the prompt engineering technique, I crafted a custom prompt that incorporate instructions about what the CodeLlama model should do. The prompt also includes the errored code and the error message generated by the Python interpreter. This prompt acts as input to the CodeLlama model. </p>
<p>
Considering the error message with respect to the user's code, the CodeLlama model produces the error-free fixed code. The second model here is the Zephyr model. A custom prompt mentioning "explain the error" and the user-provided error message is passed to the Zephyr model. After understanding the error, the model outputs a short but accurate explanation of the error message. Streamlit is used to develop the web app.</p>
<h3>Python Code Writer</h3>
<p>In this system, the model CodeLlama model for writing the Python code as per the user-provided question. A custom prompt has been designed mentioning that the model is an expert Python programmer and its job is to write error-free Python code as per the user's question. This prompt plus the question asked is given to the model to generate an accurate and optimized Python code. </p>
<h2>Code Llama</h2>

</p>
<p>Code Llama is a code-specialized version of Llama 2 that was created by further training Llama 2 on its code-specific datasets, sampling more data from that same dataset for longer. Essentially, Code Llama features enhanced coding capabilities, built on top of Llama 2. It can generate code, and natural language about code, from both code and natural language prompts. It can also be used for code completion and debugging. </p>
<h2>Zephyr 7B Beta</h2>

</p>
<p>
Zephyr is a series of language models that are trained to act as helpful assistants. Zephyr-7B-Î² is the second model in the series, and is a fine-tuned version of mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1 that was trained on on a mix of publicly available, synthetic datasets using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
